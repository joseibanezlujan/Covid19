# **COVID-19 Outbreak Mortality Rate in Spain Analysis Case Study**

# Case Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands. 

A posterior genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February. By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country and a lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020. On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days. By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country.

Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates. On 25 March, the official death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China. On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period‚Äîat the time, the most by any country in a single day. On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time, and 1 June was the first day without deaths by COVID-19. 

The state of alarm ended on 21 June. However, the number of cases increased again in July in a number of cities including Barcelona, Zaragoza and Madrid, which led to reimposition of some restrictions but no national lockdown. As of 11 December 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 638 million cases and 6.62 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.

# Business Problem

According to National Epidemiology Centre (ISCIII-CNE), until November 16, 2022 Spain presented 410 deaths per million inhabitants approximately.

### üí≠ **<ins>Analysis questions</ins>**:

* What was the evolution of the mortality rate in Spain compared to other European countries?
* Did factors such as the incidence of diabetes and average age influence the countries' mortality rate?
* What was the impact of vaccination in Spain on the mortality rate compared to other countries?

### üí° **<ins>Objective</ins>**: 

Analyze COVID-19 evolution in Spain and the behavior of the mortality rate compared to other European countries.<br/>

| Scope of the study | Type of analysis | Tools used |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| Longitudinal: Beginning of Covid-19 Outbreak until Dec 11, 2022 |   Exploratory   | Excel - SQL - Power BI |

# Data Extraction and Cleaning

The data used for the analysis was obtained from [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), as of December 11, 2022. I have filtered and saved all the relevant data into two excel files and import them to my Portfolio SQL database as:

* Table "CovidDeaths" containing:  location, date, population, cases, deaths and hospitalization related information.
* Table "CovidVaccinations" containing: location, date, age, gdp, diseases and other vaccination related data. 


# Creating Queries and Views

Due to the volume of data recorded on database I have created views with the **CREATE VIEW** function, which will display the specific dataset allowing us to analyze each of the questions in detail.

üìç<ins>Evolution of Mortality rate in Spain</ins><br/>Mortality rate was calculated with respect to the total number of Covid death cases. Nevertheless, it was important to calculate the infection rate per population to compare the proportion of deaths with respect to the total number of inhabitants. Calculations are shown from the date of Case 0 in each country.

Check the following script for SQL SERVER (it is not possible and recommended to use an 'ORDER BY' in a SQL SERVER view, however in MySQL or Oracle is possible):

```sql
CREATE VIEW TasaMortPob AS
 SELECT Location, date, population, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, 
 ROUND((CAST(total_deaths as FLOAT)/CAST(total_cases as FLOAT))* 100, 4) AS perc_tasamortalidad,
 ROUND((CAST(total_cases as FLOAT)/CAST(population as FLOAT))* 100, 4) AS perc_contagiados
 FROM Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths  
```
Then, we retrieve the information stored on TasaMortPob ordered by total_cases number in descending order and selecting 'Spain' as location.

```sql
SELECT * from Portfolio.dbo.TasaMortPob
WHERE location = 'Spain'
ORDER BY total_cases desc
```
After we filter the total deaths by country *location* and *population* number. We use an aggregate function to see a summary of the information in the previous view, since this one only shows the maximum numbers up to the December 11 cutoff.

```sql
CREATE VIEW RESTotalMuertos AS
 SELECT location, population, MAX(CAST(total_deaths as FLOAT)) AS total_muertos
 FROM Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths
 GROUP BY location, population 
```

Once we created the view we proceed to obtain the data for all the european countries and arrange them from highest to lowest total deaths count.

```sql
SELECT * from Portfolio.dbo.RESUMEN
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
ORDER BY total_muertos DESC
```

üìç<ins>Indicators of diabetes incidence and average age</ins><br/>
Only aggregate functions were used for this view, since the values for diabetes incidence and average age are the same for all records up to the cutoff date.<br/>The average of both variables was calculated and grouped with **GROUP BY** by location and number of inhabitants as the previous view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW DIATasaContagPob AS
  SELECT location, population, AVG(ROUND(median_age,0)) AS EdadProm
    , ROUND(AVG(diabetes_prevalence),2) AS Diabetes
    , MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS totalDeath 
    ,MAX(total_deaths/population)*100 AS perc_tasamortal
  FROM Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths
  GROUP BY location, population
```
After DIATasaContagPob view is created we retrieve the mentioned data ordered by perc_tasamortal in descending order.

```sql
  SELECT * FROM Portfolio.dbo.DIATasaContagPob
  ORDER BY perc_tasamortal desc
```

üìç<ins>Vaccination and mortality</ins><br/>
It is necessary to join with **JOIN** the information from the *CovidDeaths* and *CovidVaccinations* tables to contrast the mortality rate with the number of new vaccinations per day *new_vaccinations*. In this case we used the function **OVER(PARTITION BY)** instead of **GROUP BY** because the latter is limited to show the attributes by which the groups are grouped and excludes relevant variables for our analysis such as *date and population*.<br/>Let's see the script!

```sql
CREATE VIEW PobVaccinated AS 
	  SELECT dea.location, dea.date, dea.population
		  ,vac.new_vaccinations
		  ,CAST(people_vaccinated_per_hundred as float) AS perc_pob_vac
		  ,SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations as float)) 
		  OVER(PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as total_vac
	  FROM Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths dea
	  JOIN Portfolio.dbo.CovidVaccinations vac
	  ON dea.location = vac.location AND dea.date = vac.date
```

# Analysis and Results

For a better understanding of the data I developed a dynamic Dashboard in Power BI.<br/>
Try it out [**here**](https://bit.ly/3tUNgzS).

‚úîÔ∏è **What was the evolution of the mortality rate in Spain compared to other European countries?**<br/>
As shown in the graph, Spain is the European country with the highest mortality rate on average (8.9%), those following are CountryB (0.0%) and CountryC (0.0%), i.e. approximately X out of every 100 Spanish COVID-19 cases have died in Spain.

With respect to the total population of 47.33 million, X out of every 1000 Spaniards on average (0.00%) have died from COVID-19 to date.

‚úîÔ∏è **Did factors such as the incidence of diabetes and average age influence the countries' mortality rate?**<br/>No influence of diabetes incidence and average age of the population on the mortality rate in European countries is observed. The scatter plot does not show any trend between Diabetes Prevalence and Mortality Rate, nor between Average Age and Mortality Rate, so the probable influence of these variables is ruled out.

REVISAR EJEMPLO: For example, if we consider age as a determinant of mortality, this premise can be invalidated when evaluating the case of Uruguay: With an average age higher than the rest of the countries, it presents one of the lowest mortality rates, since approximately 2 out of every 1000 Uruguayans die from COVID-19.

‚úîÔ∏è **What impact did vaccination in Spain have on the mortality rate compared to other countries?**<br/>The mortality rate before January 4 (vaccination start date) was 9.14%, by the end of 2021 this figure decreased to 8.89%. In other words, 3 out of every 1000 infected (-0.25%) stopped dying after vaccination.
