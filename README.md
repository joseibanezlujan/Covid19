The COVID-19 pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 November 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 638 million cases and 6.62 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history. (source wikipedia)

I wanted to make a study using the dataset shared by OurWorldInData website and have a clear understanding about how this impacted on different areas of the world using Excel/PowerBi and SQL for this project.

You may find an updated Covid19 number of death data files on https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
